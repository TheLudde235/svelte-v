# How to use v

If you haven't already, I'd recommend to read: [What is v?](https://github.com/TheLudde235/svelte-v/blob/master/README.md) to understand why this exists.

## Basics 
When you click the links a script is copied to the computers clipboard.
To then run the scripts paste them to where they are supposed to go.

## Open program scripts
This only works on windows with access to powershell, the powershell window does not need to be elevated (run as an administrator).

1. Pick the sound you want the computer to use. 
2. Press the `copy open-program script (ps1)` button associated with that sound.
3. Open a PowerShell window, either by pressing `Win + R`, then typing "powershell", or using windows search.
4. Paste `Ctrl + v`, `Ctrl + Ins` or right click and paste.
5. Close the Windows and wait untill they open an app.

## Pop-up
This only works on windows, depending on how you'd like to use it you also need access to Run or to being able to change shortcut destinations.

1. Type what you want the pop-up to say, Note: This cannot be empty
2. Press the `Copy pop-up (run)` button.
3. 
	a) Open Run (`Win + R`), paste and hit enter.
	b) Paste into a shortcuts destination.
